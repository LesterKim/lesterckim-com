            <p>I spent my career at startups, from pre-seed to pre-IPO, most recently as Head of Engineering at <a href="https://balcony.technology">Balcony</a>.</p>
            <p>My preferred stack is Rust, HTMX, GCP, & Postgres.</p>
            <p>I am a big fan of TDD and Clean Architecture.</p>
            <p>I am an even bigger fan of having engineers speak with customers/prospects during product development.</p>
            <p>I live in Astoria, NY with my partner. In my spare time, I practice MMA.</p>
